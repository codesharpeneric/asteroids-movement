# Asteroids Movement
The aim here is to roughly clone the movement of the spaceship in the classic arcade game Asteroids.

## Objectives
- Left and Right will rotate the ship
- Up and Down will accelerate forward and backward respectively
- In space your velocity remains constant unless acted upon
- The player should teleport to the opposite edge of the screen if they hit the edge of the play area

## Secondary Considerations
- Previous poc did not have any way to interact on mobile platforms
